# Snake AI with Deep Q-Learning

This project is a Python implementation of a Snake game where the AI learns to play using Deep Q-Learning. The AI agent is trained to maximize its score by exploring the game environment, and learning optimal moves through reward-based training. The model is built using PyTorch.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- `pygame` for game visualization
- `torch` for building and training the neural network model
- `numpy` for array manipulation
- `matplotlib` for plotting training results

You can install the necessary libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install pygame torch numpy matplotlib
